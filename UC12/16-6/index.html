    <h1>SWAT Team Robot Successfully Dismantles Black Man</h1>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>
      LUBBOCK, TX—Saying the threat posed too great a risk to the life of its
      officers, the Lubbock Police Department confirmed Thursday its SWAT team
      had deployed a robot that succeeded in dismantling a potentially dangerous
      Black man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spokesperson for the department, which reportedly received dozens of
      calls from individuals claiming to have seen a Black man at a crowded
      downtown bus shelter, stated that a perimeter was established and the area
      was promptly evacuated. Law enforcement officials explained that in
      situations where a Black man is detected and cannot be destroyed by
      conventional police methods, the protocol is to send in a tactical robot.
    </p>
    <h2>"This is exactly the kind of threat police train for."</h2>
    <p>
      “We get plenty of false alarms and hoaxes, but if there’s a real chance
      we’re dealing with an actual Black man, we’ll always prioritize the safety
      of our personnel and call in the unmanned unit,” SWAT team commander Lt.
      Wyatt Hayes said of the robot that, with the aid of sensors mounted on its
      manipulator arm, could be operated at a distance of more than 1,000 feet
      from the Black man. “It’s our obligation to keep our officers out of
      harm’s way if we can, and we’re fortunate to have the technology that
      enables us to do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what’s important right now is that residents remain calm,” Hayes
      added. “This is exactly the kind of threat police train for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As it advanced toward the target on its dual, tanklike treads, the robot
      assessed the scene with its camera and confirmed that an actual Black man
      was in fact present. According to police, the robot then began
      transmitting critical visual information to the specialist who would guide
      it throughout the delicate dismantling operation.

      “You might think you’re well outside the radius where a Black man can do
      you any harm, but you don’t truly know what you’re up against until you’re
      in there,” said Sgt. Roland Meyer, visibly perspiring as he remotely
      extended the robot’s arm and carefully guided its gripper claw into
      position. “In this line of work, it’s impossible to be too cautious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the public is counting on us to protect them from this kind of
      thing,” Meyer continued. “At the end of the day, we just want the people
      we serve to feel safe in this community.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Officers eyed a nearby monitor anxiously as Meyer rotated the robot’s
      gripper and, once the appropriate angle had been achieved, began the
      dismantling procedure. After several tense minutes of precision maneuvers,
      the Black man was successfully neutralized and a relieved Meyer flashed a
      thumbs-up to a round of applause.
    </p>

      With no further risk from the Black man, police reopened the area to the
      public. While some locals returned and quickly resumed their day, others
      said they weren’t ready to go back yet.
    </p>

      “I’m grateful to the police, but it’s still unsettling to know there was a
      Black man in my very own neighborhood,” said Darlene Hoover, a resident of
      a nearby apartment building who told reporters she would probably stay
      with friends several miles away for the time being. “For all I know, there
      could be one in a restaurant or at the park or the supermarket. I just
      don’t know if I’ll ever feel comfortable here again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismantling follows an incident last month in which a Black man was
      spotted on a plane at Lubbock International Airport but was successfully
      detonated by police just before takeoff.
