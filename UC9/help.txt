Project versioning explained:

    The project’s version follows the version of the SQLite library that is bundled in the jar, with an extra digit to denote the project’s increment.

    For example, if the SQLite version is 3.39.2, the project version will be 3.39.2.x, where x starts at 0, and increments with every release that is not changing the SQLite version.

    If the SQLite version is updated to 3.40.0, the project version will be updated to 3.40.0.0.
